# 💊 DawaDar

**DawaDar** is a web app designed to help families manage their medications efficiently — tracking doses, schedules, and pill stock levels for each family member.  
This project was initially developed during **ArrabaHack 2025** (a 12-hour hackathon) and is now being improved into a more functional and user-friendly version.

- Notifications appear automatically after a set delay (mocked in this version).
